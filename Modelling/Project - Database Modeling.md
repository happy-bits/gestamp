# Project - modeling the database

## Specify 

Write down what you should model in a document. Use natural language.

If you later change this document, keep a copy of the original version so history is preserved.

Search for
- People
- Things
- Locations
- Events

## Execute 

Create a ER-diagram with:
- Multiple **one-to-many** relationships
- Multiple **many-to-many** relationships

The ER-diagram must contain at least 8 entities.

Model the database from the ER-diagram. 

Take a screenshot of the database model **every hour** (to get the history)

## Presentation 

Present you work in 8 minutes:
- Why did you choose this model?
- Explain the process
    * The development of the ER-diagram
    * The development of the database diagram
- Explain the end result (ER-diagram + database diagram + specification)
- Show some detail of the solution that you find interesting
- What have you learned?
- What was challenging? 
- If you continued, what would you do then?
