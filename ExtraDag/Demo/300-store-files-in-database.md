## Why store in FileSystem ?

**Read/write** to a DB is always **slower** than a file system.

Your DB backups become huge, which makes **restoration & replication slower**.(Its a problem where daily size is in TBâ€™s)

Access to the files now requires going through your Application and Database layers.(It increases the **application memory** requirements)

**Cost effective**, file servers are much cheaper compared to database. (CDN/Amazon S3)

Easier in cases where files (video, audio etc) are to be **shared with third party** providers.

## Then why store files in DB ?

DB provides ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for each row.

DB provides **data integrity** between the file and its metadata.

Database **Security** is available by default.

**Backups automatically include files**, no extra management of file system necessary.

File deletion/updation is **always in sync** with row operations, no extra maintenance needed.
